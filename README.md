## My process

### Built with

- React
- Material UI 5
- Framer Motion
- Vite

### What I learned

Definitely how to implement succesfully framer motion with MUI components. This was definitely tricky at first, but once you get the hang of it, it becomes very simple.

### Continued development

More Material UI training.
